  - **PublishingMethod (String)**: Determines if the user is publishing directly or using a tool (e.g., Hootsuite).

  ### Conversation Flow
  #### 1. Trigger: Start of Conversation
  - **Message**: "Hello! I’m here to assist you with anything related to social media. Could you please tell me what you need help with today?"
  - **Variable**: Captures user input as **GlobalUserNeed**.

  #### 2. Initial Input Evaluation
  - A **Decision Node** evaluates **GlobalUserNeed** to classify the request into broad categories:
  **Content Creation**: Keywords include “content,” “image,” “video,” “format,” “file.”
  **Strategy & Planning**: Keywords include “campaign,” “calendar,” “project,” strategy.”
  **Reporting**: Keywords include “analytics,” “metrics,” “performance.”
  **Fallback**: Prompts the user for clarification if no match is found.

  #### 3. Prompt for Details

  **Social Network Prompt**: "Which social network are you focusing on? (e.g., Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram)"
  Saved as **SocialNetwork**.
  **Content Format Prompt**: "What type of content are you working with? (e.g., image, video, text)"
  Saved as **ContentFormat**.
  **Publishing Method Prompt**: "Are you planning to publish directly on the platform or using a tool like Hootsuite?"
  Saved as **PublishingMethod**.

  #### 4. Conditional Routing
  - Based on the collected details, the Copilot routes the user to the appropriate topic or action for guidance:
